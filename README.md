# DataWrangling_Capstone
Apply data wrangling to your capstone project
At this time, you've probably decided on your capstone project, and even have some raw data to work with (In case you're not at that point yet, just come back to this exercise when you are).

Your raw data needs to be cleaned and wrangled into a form you can analyze. Here are a few suggested steps:
* Clean up your column names to be simple, short and descriptive

For each column:
* Check for missing values and decide what you want to do about them.
* Make sure the values in each column make sense. If you find values that don't, decide what you want to do about those.
* Look for outliers (values that are too small or too large). Do they make sense? Do you want to keep them in the data set?
* Discuss with your mentor about other data wrangling steps you might need to perform for your specific problem and implement those.
* Save your cleaned up and transformed data set.
